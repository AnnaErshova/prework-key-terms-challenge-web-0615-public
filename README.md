# Prework Key Terms Challenge

Welcome to your first prework challenge! In this one, we're going to review what we just learned in the previous section on some key terms in web development.

## A Note about Challenges

End of the unit challenges are like little end goals for the unit. They're mini reviews of what you've just learned and most importantly, exercises in a few things:

  * familiarizing yourself with RSpec tests
  * practicing the git/Github workflow
  * learning to read error messages

At the end of the day, your ability to pass these challenges isn't really important; we don't believe in tests as markers of accomplishment with learning to program. But for us, they are markers of your progress through the material, so just treat them as such.

## Directions

1. Fork this repository, clone that fork, and open up the directory in terminal.

2. Open up the file in the `spec` directory called `key_terms_spec.rb`. This is our RSpec file where the tests for this challenge live. You'll be inputting your answers on this file.

3. Within each test, you'll see something like this:

```ruby
your_answer = __
```

Replace the __ with your answer in quotes, like this `"AJAX"`.

The test will be looking at your answer and comparing it to the correct answer.

4. **When you've finished answering all of the questions**, run `ironboard` (which will be running the tests; remember this is in leiu of running `rspec`) and make sure you're seeing all green.

5. When you're finished (all of the tests pass and you're seeing green in your terminal), put your git skills to use!
* Stage the changes you made: `git add .`
* Commit those changes with a message: `git commit -m "all done"`
* Push those changed up to your fork: `git push origin master`
* Then open up a pull request on the original repository (that you cloned from).

Refer back to the previous sections, especially the first lab, if you need to.
